<p>We demand funding for women-focused-on-the-land camps so that young Indigenous women can access a sense of home in a safe community environment, as well as participate in on-the-land activities so that they can experience the healing power of cultural revitalisation. We demand that these homes be built off-grid to promote self-determination and traditional living which includes living independent of rent, utility payments, and other potential sources of debt or arrears. We seek to prevent experiences of homelessness and unsheltered living amongst young Indigenous women, thereby addressing the kinds of individual and structural violence underlying the disproportionate number of MMIWG. </p>


<p>We see our initiative as an intergovernmental collaboration between federal, territorial, municipal and Indigenous governments as well as partnerships with private construction firms, all led by Indigenous women. To this aim, we aim to direct federal funding to Indigenous governments and Indigenous-led organizations, with Indigenous People in leadership of all future program development. We are seeking funding from organizations such as CMHC - Northern Housing Funds, the Indigenous Shelter and Transitional Housing Initiative, the Women and Children Shelter and Transitional Housing Initiative and the National Housing Strategy Co-Investment Fund. We have also developed a flexible 7-year term financial structure, to allow for sustainable and long-term project development and implementation. Furthermore, policy changes are required with the NWT Power Corporation to allow residents to produce their own power over a 20% max in order to live fully off-grid. Our vision is to establish a camp on Yellowknives Dene First Nation territory that may still require policy change on the part of the City of Yellowknife to permit small/tiny home community developments on unceded YKDFN lands within municipal limits.  </p>
