<p>Ambient ecosystems are urban systems that are usually not perceived as important to housing in the city. But they are fundamental to housing in the city. They are holistic systems having to do with population density, public space, mobility networks, commercial complexity, green space, metabolics, social cohesion and governance. These systems are woven throughout the city, providing services to all housing.</p><p>Social housing is often placed on sites that are alienated from these urban ecosystems. This alienation places a serious burden on disadvantaged inhabitants, dooming them to an unserved, insecure, and unhealthy future. Also, the trend to privatize public space in the city distracts from these ambient ecosystems, further reducing their perceived importance. We must decommodify the commons. A robust and equitably accessible commons is what creates thriving communities. Collective social housing needs the services that these ecosystems provide. They cannot just be for the privileged. Any housing without these ambient ecosystems is alienating.</p><p>Our demand is multidimensional. We demand an ambient-ecosystems commons that is designed and inhabited through a participatory process centered on local communities. Embedding housing in rich ambient ecosystems will create public spaces that foster a sense of community, accessible mobility services, commercial and social services that are diverse, local, and nourishing, green spaces that are biodiverse and safe, and governance that is participatory and effective. The ambient must continuously reflect the evolving needs of these communities.</p><p>We demand a charter that will uphold this ambient-ecosystems commons as continuously accessible, participative, and necessary to housing. The charter calls for all-stakeholder partnerships to explore scenario-based migratory paths towards better services for social housing. These goals will be realized through policy changes that ensure the continuity of the ambient realms, a financial strategy that calls for dedicated governmental support, changes to municipal taxation powers, the obligation to collaborate between levels of government, and the adoption of realistic, long-term and climate-centered green infrastructure financing so that improvements to the ambient ecosystems can be acted upon with confidence.</p><h3>Policy Proposal</h3><p>First, policy must be corrected to ensure the continuity of the ambient realms.</p><ol><li>Provincial policy must grant each city domain over its ambient urban realms. This domain may not be privatized, and authority over these ambient realms may not be conferred elsewhere. The ambient realms form an organic and indivisible support to urban housing, the governance of which remains in the collective.</li><li>Each city must recognize the obligation to balance governance of these ambient realms with the influence these realms have on the region within which the city exists, and each city must commit to restoring the region’s traditional connection to Indigenous populations.</li><li>The citizen’s right to initiate projects (le pouvoirde l’initiative) must be an inalienable right in the urban charter, and urban policy must support the enabling of this right.</li></ol><h3>Financial Strategy</h3><p>Second, financing must be established to ensure the development of the ambient realms.</p><ol><li>The city must attribute indexed, resilient budgets for spontaneous participatory process and project development.</li><li>To create resilience, these budgets must be financed into realistic futures, over the foreseeable timescales of the global environment, explicitly rejecting the timescales of short-term financing models.</li><li>The city must have the right to guaranteed taxation and/or intergovernmental transfers to support the development of the ambient realms.</li><h3>Participatory Process</h3><p>Design is process, sometimes revealing existing architectures, sometimes creating new. Each city has a unique architecture that can be described in terms of its ambient realms. The design strategy we propose is the spontaneous development of the ambient.</p><ol><li>To reveal potential in the ambient realms, and so the areas to target for spontaneous occupation, mapping is required.</li><li>To create the scenario-based migratory paths that will become models of development, holistic partnerships are required.</li><li>The intersection between the ambient realms and three urban housing types will be explored: individual street addresses (3-storey), collective street address (3-storey), collective street address (high-rise). In each case, local ambient systems will be analyzed, the potential realms to target will be identified, and an example of occupation or modification proposed.</li></ol></ol>
