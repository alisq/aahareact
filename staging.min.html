<p>“Redress is a term used to describe reparations for past injustice associated with some form of discrimination, exclusion, or act of violence against a group of people and can take the form of various kinds of reparations (apologies or financial compensation) and best decided upon by legislators not the court system. Reparations were something that people of African descent fought for… following the abolishment of slavery and yet it was the former enslavers who were given compensation by the state for the loss of their financial benefits…” - Stephanie Allen, Fight the Power: Redressing Displacement and Building a Just City for Black Lives in Vancouver…, 2019</p><p>Redress is required to address the harm caused by systemic anti-Black racism within government led infrastructure projects leading to the displacement of Black lives and destruction of paths for Black communities to improve our housing security. This anti-Black racism has resulted in Black people having the lowest homeownership rates in c\a\n\a\d\a.</p><p>In Little Jamaica, Toronto, all three levels of governments have aligned to invest billions of dollars into public transit along our arterial road while ignoring calls from Black communities to be supported in our ongoing efforts to increase Black ownership of property in the neighbourhood so as to increase our access to affordable housing. Rather than respond to calls for support, public funds have been used to enrich the same land‘lords’ who have profited off our rent for generations.</p><p>We demand that redress is enacted through all three levels of government providing wholesome compensation to the Black-led Community Land Trust for the purchase and development of housing and commercial space. Government funding is to be paired with land use and economic policies that enable displaced Black renters the right to return and rebuild their community in Little Jamaica and to intensification without displacement.</p>
