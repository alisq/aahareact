To this aim, we aim to direct federal funding to Indigenous governments and Indigenous-led organizations, with Indigenous People in leadership of all future program development. We are seeking funding from organizations such as CMHC - Northern Housing Funds, the Indigenous Shelter and Transitional Housing Initiative, the Women and Children Shelter and Transitional Housing Initiative and the National Housing Strategy Co-Investment Fund. We have also developed a flexible 7-year term financial structure, to allow for sustainable and long-term project development and implementation. Furthermore, policy changes are required with the NWT Power Corporation to allow residents to produce their own power over a 20% max in order to live fully off-grid.
